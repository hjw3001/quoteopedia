You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore
them, because they change things, they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy
ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones
who do."

control our learning and knowledge, so that we use it to destroy ourselves?"
"Even if that is so, knowledge remains better than ignorance. It is better to know
even if the knowledge endures only for the moment that comes before destruction

Achilles, and it is mine, too."

what I want."

"From time to time it's fun to close our eyes, and in that dark say to ourselves, 'I am

lifting stage-center. And sure enough, there's our world, just the way we've built it."

"That's what learning is, after all; not whether we lose the game, but how we lose and
how we've changed because of it and what we take away from it that we never had

"The world's not a sphere... it's a big floating pyramid. At the bottom of the pyramid is the lowest life-form you can imagine, hateful, vicious, destroying for destruction's sake, devoid of empathy, one step above consciousness so savage it self-destructs the instant it's born. There's room for that kind of consciousness, lots of room, right here on our triangular third planet. At the top is consciousness so refined it barely recognizes anything but light. Beings who live for their loves, for their highest right, creatures of perfect perspective, who die with a loving smile upon whatever monster would strike them down for the fun of watching someone die. Whales are like that, I think. Most dolphins. Some people... the human beings among us."

"In some village, city, market town, country district, province, kingdom, or capital there lived a householder, old, advanced in years, decrepit, weak
in health and strength, but rich, wealthy, and well-to-do.  His house was a large one, both extensive and high, and it was old, having been built a
long time ago.  It was inhabited by many living beings, some two, three, four, or five hundred.  It had one single door only.  It was thatched with
straw, its terraces had fallen down, its foundations were rotten, its walls, matting-screens, and plaster were in an advanced state of decay.
Suddenly a great blaze of fire broke out, and the house started to burn on all sides.  And that man had many young sons, five, or ten, or twenty, and
he himself got out of the house.

When that man saw his own house ablaze all around with that great mass of fire, he became afraid and trembled, his mind became agitated, and he
thought to himself: `I, it is true, have been competent enough to run out of the door, and to escape from my burning house, quickly and safely,
without being touched or scorched by that great mass of fire. But what about my sons, my young boys, my little sons?  There, in this burning house,
they play, sport, and amuse themselves with all sorts of games.  They do not know that this dwelling is afire, and so they feel no agitation.  Though
threatened by this great [fire] , though in such close contact with so much ill, they pay no attention to their danger, and make no effort to get out.'"

"[The traveler] may feel assured, he will meet with no difficulties or dangers,
excepting in rare cases, nearly so bad as he beforehand anticipates.  In a moral
point of view, the effect ought to be, to teach him good-humored patience,
freedom from selfishness, the habit of acting for himself, and of making the best
of every occurrence. . .  Traveling ought also to teach him distrust; but at the
same time he will discover, how many truly kind-hearted people there are, with
whom he never before had, or ever again will have any further communication,
who yet are ready to offer him the most disinterested assistance."

"What is it about the idea of a god that gives it its stability and penetrance in the
cultural environment?  The survival value of the god meme in the meme pool results from its
great psychological appeal.  It provides a superficially plausible answer to deep and troubling
questions about existence.  It suggests that injustices in this world may be rectified in the
next.  The 'everlasting arms' hold out a cushion against our own inadequacies which, like a
doctor's placebo, is none the less effective for being imaginary.  These are some of the reasons
why the idea of God is copied so readily by successive generations of individual brains.  God
exists, if only in the form of a meme with high survival value, or infective power, in the
environment provided by human culture."

"But what, after all, is faith?  It is a state of mind that leads people
to believe something -- it doesn't matter what -- in the total absence
of supporting evidence.  If there were good supporting evidence then
faith would be superfluous, for the evidence would compel us to believe
it anyway.  It is this that makes the often-parroted claim that
'evolution itself is a matter of faith' so silly.  People believe in
evolution not because they arbitrarily want to believe it but because of
overwhelming, publicly available evidence."
<p>
-- Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene
<p>
"Faith cannot move mountains (though generations of children are
solemnly told the contrary and believe it).  But it is capable of
driving people to such dangerous folly that faith seems to me to qualify
as a kind of mental illness.  It leads people to believe in whatever it
is so strongly that in extreme cases they are prepared to kill and to
die for it without the need for further justification."

"A human being is part of a whole, called by us the Universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences
himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest --  a kind of optical delusion of his

that essentially adds more shopping hours to the old exaltation of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Our children are being raised in
this tepid faith with what amounts to fanatic zeal: the average American child, by the time he or she leaves high school, has been subjected to
more than 380,000 TV commercials.  The role of advertising in our daily lives has grown so immense that it has become difficult to remember what
it was like before the subliminal flood of "brand synergies" came to fill every corner of public space.  Billions of dollars and fantastic
amounts of energy are, after all, devoted annually to the creation ex nihilo of new desires--anxieties that, by design, only more consumption

"Back home in the Wild West, time whips by with the relentless and terrible
purpose of a stranglevine vine filmed in fast motion. A week, two months, ten
years snap past like amnesia, a continual barrage of workdays, appointments,
dinner dates and laundromats, television shows and video cassettes, parking
meters, paydays and phone calls.

You can watch it from Asia. You read the newspapers, you think about your
friends back home - marching along in the parade of events - and you know it's
still happening. It's happening there. On the other side. Yesterdays, todays and
tomorrows are tumbling after each other like Sambo and the tiger, blending into
an opaque and viscous ooze. There is no such thing as now; only a continual
succession of laters, whipping their tendrils around the calendar. The clutches of
the vine...

In Nepal, the phenomenon is reversed. Time is a stick of incense that burns
without being consumed. One day can seem like a week; a week, like months.
Mornings stretch out and crack their spines with the yogic impassivity of house
cats. Afternoons bulge with a succulent ripeness, like fat peaches. There is time
enough to do everything - write a letter, eat breakfast, read the paper, visit a
shrine or two, listen to the birds, bicycle downtown to change money, buy
postcards, shop for Buddhas - and arrive home in time for lunch."

"Why don't we teach astrology in the schools?  Astrology holds that the
course of each human life is determined to a considerable degree by the
position of the stars in the sky at the exact moment of the individual's
birth.  Belief in it, in one variant or another, has probably been held
by most of the people on earth.  Even today, some universities in India
offer degrees in the subject.  Yet American believers do not pressure
boards of education to add their subject to the curriculum.  If believers
in astrology became as well organized as the creationists, it is hard to
see how their demands could be withstood."

When asked: What did God do before he created the universe?  Augustine

Instead, he said that time was a property of the universe that God
created, and that time did not exist before the beginning of the
universe."

"The quantum theory of gravity has opened up a new possibility, in
which there would be no boundary to space-time and so there would be
no need to specify the behavior at the boundary.  There would be no
singularities at which the laws of science broke down and no edge of
space-time at which one would have to appeal to God or some new law to
set the boundary conditions for space-time.  One could say: 'The
boundary condition of the universe is that it has no boundary.'  The
universe would be completely self-contained and not affected by
anything outside itself.  It would neither be created nor destroyed.
It would just BE."
<p>
-- Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time
<p>
"The idea that space and time may form a closed surface without boundary
also has profound implications for the role of God in the affairs of the
universe.  With the success of scientific theories in describing events,
most people have come to believe that God allows the universe to evolve
according to a set of laws and does not intervene in the universe to
break these laws.  However, the laws do not tell us what the universe
should have looked like when it started -- it would still be up to God
to wind up the clockwork and choose how to start it off.  So long as the
universe had a beginning, we could suppose it had a creator.  But if the
universe is really completely self-contained, having no boundary or
edge, it would have neither beginning nor end: it would simply be.  What
place, then, for a creator?"

"On the need to travel:
After living a long time in one place and in the same rut, I feel that for a certain time it is enough, that I must refresh myself with other horizons and other faces... and at the same time must retire into myself, strange as that sounds. The superficial distractions of the journey do not interfere.
There are people who prefer to get away inwardly, some with the help of a powerful imagination and an ability to abstract themselves from their surroundings (for this a special endowment is needed, bordering on genius and insanity), some with the help of opium or alcohol. Russians, for instance, will have a drinking bout for a week or two, and then go back to their homes and duties. I prefer shifting my whole body to shifting my brain, and going around the world to letting my head go round.

Perhaps it is because I have a bad head after too much to drink."

clouds, disappear, reappear, People watch them, mark them. They walk by
the side of precipices. They daringly pursue their road. See them aloft,
see them in the distance; they are but black specks. On they go. The
road is uneven, its difficulties constant. At each step a wall, at each
step a trap. As they rise the cold increases. They must make their ladder, cut
the ice and walk on it., hewing the steps in haste. A storm is raging.
Nevertheless they go forward in their madness. The air becomes difficult
to breath. The abyss yawns below them. Some fall. Others stop and retrace
their steps; there is a sad weariness. The bold ones continue. They are
eyed by the eagles; the lightning plays about them: the hurricane is
furious. No matter, they persevere."

disencumbered ourselves, by laying aside whatever we could spare; for it is not
to be imagined without experience, how in climbing crags and treading bogs,

home with his own resolution, will, in the hour of darkness and fatigue, be
content to leave behind him everything but himself."

"He that travels in theory has no inconveniences; he has shade and sunshine at
his disposal, and wherever he alights finds tables of plenty and looks of gaiety.
These ideas are indulged till the day of departure arrives, the chaise is called,
and the progress of happiness begins.  A few miles teach him the fallacies of
imagination.  The road is dusty, the air is sultry, the horses are sluggish, and the
postilion brutal.  He longs for the time of dinner that he may eat and rest.  The inn
is crowded, his orders are neglected, and nothing remains but that he devour in
haste what the cook has spoiled, and drive on in quest of better entertainment.
He finds at night a more commodious house, but the best is always worse than he expected."

"One of the great undiscovered joys of life comes from doing everything
one attempts to the best of one's ability. There is a special sense of
satisfaction, a pride in surveying such a work, a work which is rounded,
full, exact, complete in its parts, which the superficial person who
leaves his or her work in a slovenly, slipshod, half-finished condition,
can never know. It is this conscientious completeness which turns any
work into art. The smallest task, well done, becomes a miracle of
achievement."

"People who have accomplished work worthwhile have had a very high sense
of the way to do things. They have not been content with mediocrity.
They have not confined themselves to the beaten tracks; they have never
been satisfied to do things just as others so them, but always a little
better. They always pushed things that came to their hands a little
higher up, this little farther on, that counts in the quality of life's
work. It is constant effort to be first-class in everything one attempts

"If you look up 'atheism' in a dictionary, you will probably find it
defined as the belief that there is no God.  Certainly many people
understand atheism in this way.  Yet many atheists do not, and this is
not what the term means if one consider it from the point of view of its
Greek roots.  In Greek 'a' means 'without' or 'not' and 'theos' means
'god.'  From this standpoint an atheist would simply be someone without
a belief in God, not necessarily someone who believes that God does not
exist.  According to its Greek roots, then, atheism is a negative view,
characterized by the absence of belief in God."

"C.S. Lewis is certainly right to suppose that in considering the
question of whether miracles exist there is a danger that one will
appear to a priori arguments and assumptions.  But the solution
to this problem is not to decide on naturalism or supernaturalism
beforehand.  Rather, one must attempt to reject the a priori
arguments and instead base one's position on inductive considerations.
Lewis has not shown that this is impossible.  Thus he has not shown
that one must choose between naturalism and supernaturalism before
investigating the possibility of miracles."

"Everything is a blessing, and everything comes as a gift. And I don't regret anything about the situation I find myself in. If psychedelics
don't ready you for the great beyond, then I don't know what really does. And we're all under sentence of 'moving up' at some point in our lives. I have
an absolute faith that the universe prefers joy and distills us with joy and this what religion is trying to download to us, and this is what every moment
of life is trying to do - if we can open to it. And we psychedelic people, if we could secure that death has no sting, we would have done the greatest
service to suffering intelligence that can be done. And I feel that it's close, and I feel strong. I feel strong because of this (psychedelic)
Community and these people and the plants that it rests on, and the ancient practices that it rests on, and I am full of hope, not only for my own small
problems, but for humanity in general."

"Travel is the realm of the improbable adventure, the quick fix, the ship passing
in the night.  It entitles you to meet interesting people, whom you would never
meet, even if you laid traps or advertised for them.  Not only do you meet them,
but also unmeet them, all in the space of, it often seems, a mere compacted
evening.  As there is so little time, bodies in motion drop their guard and
immediately get on with their stories.  Then the proverbial ships part, each to its
destination, never again to brush each other's wake."

the creator is the man who stands alone. Men have been taught that the ego is the
synonym of evil, and selflessness the ideal of virtue.  But the creator is the
egoist in the absolute sense, and the selfless man is the one who does not think,
feel, judge, or act. These are functions of the self."

"In the name of the best within you, do not sacrifice this world to those who
are its worst.  In the name of the values that keep you alive, do not let
your vision of man be distorted by the ugly, the cowardly, the mindless in
those who have never achieved his title.  Do not lose your knowledge that
man's proper estate is an upright posture, an intransigent mind and a step
that travels unlimited roads.  Do not let your fire go out, spark by
irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the
not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all.  Do not let the hero in your soul
perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been
able to reach.  Check your road and the nature of your battle.  The world you
desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible, it's yours."

"After centuries of being pounded with the doctrine that altruism is the
ultimate ideal, men have accepted it in the only way it could be accepted.
 By seeking self-esteem through others.  By living second-hand.  And it has
opened the way for every kind of horror.  It has become the dreadful form of
selfishness which a truly selfish man couldn't have conceived.  And now, to
cure a world perishing from selflessness, we're asked to destroy the self.
 Listen to what is being preached today.  Look at everyone around us.  You've
wondered why they suffer, why they seek happiness and never find it.  If any
man stopped and asked himself whether he's ever held a truly personal desire,
he'd find the answer.  He'd see that all his wishes, his efforts, his dreams,
his ambitions are motivated by other men.  He's not really struggling even
for material wealth, but for the second-hander's delusion -- prestige.  A
stamp of approval, not his own.  He can find no joy in the struggle and no
joy when he has succeeded.  He can't say about a single thing: 'This is what
I wanted because I wanted it, not because it made my neighbors gape at me.'
 Then he wonders why he's unhappy.  Every form of happiness is private.  Our
greatest moments are personal, self-motivated, not to be touched.  The things
which are sacred or precious to us are the things we withdraw from
promiscuous sharing.  But now we are taught to throw everything within us
into public light and common pawing.  To seek joy in meeting halls.  We
haven't even got a word for the quality I mean -- for the self-sufficiency of
man's spirit.  It's difficult to call it selfishness or egoism, the words
have been perverted, they've come to mean Peter Keating.  Gail, I think the
only cardinal evil on earth is that of placing your prime concern within
other men.  I''ve always demanded a certain quality in the people I liked.
I've always recognized it at once -- and it's the only quality I respect in
men.  I choose my friends by that.  Now I know what it is.  A self-sufficient
ego.  Nothing else matters."

nothing better than the Ku Klux Klan, the Fascisti. and Mr. Winston
Churchill?  Really I am not much impressed with the people who say:
'Look at me: I am such a splendid product that there must have been
design in the universe.'  I am not very impressed by the splendor of
those people.  Therefore I think that this argument of design is
really a very poor argument indeed.  Moreover, if you accept the
ordinary laws of science, you have to suppose that human life and
life in general on this planet will die out in due course: it is merely
a flash in the pan; it is a stage in the decay of the solar system;
at a certain stage of decay you get the sort of conditions of
temperature and so forth which are suitable to protoplasm, and there
is life for a short time in the life of the whole solar system.  You
see in the moon the sort of thing to which the earth is tending --
something dead, cold, and lifeless."

"One day I wiped out all the notions from my mind. I gave up all desire.
I discarded all the words with which I thought and stayed in quietude. I
felt a little queer-as if I were being carried into something, or as if
I were touching some power unknown to me... and Ztt! I entered. I lost
the boundary of my physical body. I had my skin, or course, but I felt I
was standing in the center of the cosmos. I spoke, but my words had lost
their meaning. I saw people coming towards me, but all were the same
man. All were myself! I had never known this world. I had believed that
I was created, but now I must change my opinion: I was never created; I
was the cosmos; no individual Mr. Sasaki existed."

the activity of making them, changes both the maker and the destination."

No way of life is inevitable.  Examine your own closely.
If you do not like it, change it.
But do not try to change it through political action. Even if you succeed in gaining power, you will not be able to use it any more wisely than your predecessors.
Ask only to be left alone to solve your problems in your own way.
Simplify your needs.  Learn how to be happy with fewer possessions.
Build a way of life in which people live together without quarreling, in a social climate of trust rather than suspicion, of love rather than jealousy, of cooperation rather than competition.
Maintain that world with gentle but pervasive ethical sanctions rather than a police or military force.
Transmit the culture effectively to new members through expert child care and a powerful educational technology.
Reduce compulsive labor to a minimum by arranging the kinds of incentives under which people enjoy working.
Regard no practice as immutable.  Change and be ready to change again.  Accept no eternal verity.  Experiment.

listen.  Pride, you said, presumption.  And now the Shadows are on the move.  The
Centauri and the younger worlds are at war, the Narns have fallen. Even the Humans
are fighting one another.  The pride was yours, the presumption was yours.  For a
thousand years we have been awaiting for fulfilment of prophecy, and when it finally
happens, you scorn it, you reject it.  Because you no longer believe it yourselves.  'We
stand between the candle and the star, between the darkness and the light.'  You say
the words, but your hearts are empty, your ears closed to the truth.  You stand for
nothing but your own petty interests.  'Problems of others are not our concern.'  I do
not blame you for standing silent in your shame.  You, who knew what was coming,
but refused to take up the burden of this war.  If the warrior caste will not fight, then
the rest of us will.  If the Council has lost its way, if it will not lead, if we have
abandoned our covenant with Valen, the Council should be broken, as was
prophesied.  We must stand with the others now, before it's too late. Between the
worker caste and the religious caste we control two thirds of our forces.  Do you, I

that we could work out our problems and build a better future, and that, to me, is the key issue.  See in the last few
years we've stumbled.  We stumbled at the death of the President, the war, and on and on.  And when you stumble
a lot you start looking at your feet.  We have to make people lift their eyes back to the horizon and see the line of
ancestors behind us saying `make my life have meaning.'  And to our inheritors before us saying 'create the world
we will live in.'  We're not just holding jobs and having dinner, we are the process of building the future.  That's

ourselves and our posterity."

"What does the candle represent?"
"Life."
"Whose life?"
"All life, every life. We're all born as molecules in the hearts of a
billion stars, molecules that do not understand politics, policies and
differences. In a billion years we, foolish molecules forget who we are
and where we came from. Desperate acts of ego. We give ourselves names,
fight over lines on maps. And pretend our light is better than everyone
else's. The flame reminds us of the piece of those stars that live inside
us. A spark that tells us: you should know better. The flame also reminds
us that life is precious, as each flame is unique. When it goes out, it's
gone forever. And there will never be another quite like it. So many
candles will go out tonight. I wonder some days if we can see anything at
all."

"I realized it's simplier to make a statue to someone who you believe
embodies all your better qualities than it is to actually improve
yourself... For the last year I've tried to point my people toward the
simple truth that we are one, reguardless of race. Somehow that message
has gotten twisted so that I have become their idea of the truth
personified. Once you turn into this you can no longer be who you are. You
can only be what they want you to be, what they expect you to be."

The Universe speaks in many languages, but only one voice.
The language is not Narn or Human or Centauri or Gaim or Minbari.

It speaks in the language of hope. It speaks in the language of trust.
It speaks in the language of strength, and the language of compassion.
It is the language of the heart and the language of the soul.
But always it is the same voice.

It is the voice of our ancestors speaking through us.
And the voice of our inheritors waiting to be born.
It is the small, still voice that says we are One.

No matter the blood, no matter the skin,
No matter the world, no matter the star,
We are One.
No matter the pain, no matter the darkness,
No matter the loss, no matter the fear.
We are One.

Here, gathered together in common cause
We agree to recognize this singular truth and this singular rule:
That we must be kind to one another.

Because each voice enriches us and ennobles us,
And each voice lost diminishes us.
We are the voice of the universe, the soul of creation,
The fire that will light the way to a better future.

We are One.

"In the old days, people used to risk their lives in India or in the Americas in
order to bring back products which now seem to us to have been of comically
little worth, such as [brazilwood and pepper, which] added a new range of sense
experience to a civilization which had never suspected its own insipidity. .
.[From] these same lands our modern Marco Polos now bring back the moral
spices of which our society feels an increasing need as it is conscious of
sinking further into boredom, but that this time they take the form of photographs,
books, and travelers tales."

"... each person took up the challenge we extended to them to live life as if each moment was important, as if each moment counted and could be worked with, even if it was a moment of pain, sadness, dispair, or fear.

"Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
"Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

"This experience, and many others since have taught me that nothing stays the same forever, that time (and the world around us) keeps moving providing opportunities for us to change our direction.
